 * Although the main purpose of the client is to pass events from the Outbound API to third party
 * applications, there may be times when information is required to pass the other way. This package
 * contains the classes necessary to implement an interface to the plugins that will allow such data
 * to be fetched from the third party application and passed on to the Abiquo server.
